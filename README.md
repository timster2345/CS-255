# CS-255

The Clinet for this project was DriverPass. The goal they wanted to reach was to make a web based driving training system.
They type of system they wanted was a secure, web-based system that ran on the cloud.
I am not sure I did anything particularly well, but if I had to choose one thing, it would be reading the interview transcript
and applying what was said/needing into the project.
If I had to choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, it would be the UML diagrams. I would add more depth to 
the diagrams to better show the processes for each of them. 
To interperet the user's needs and implement them into the system design, I would first need to understand the needs. After that,
I would create diagrams to plan out the methods and processes needed for the system to design. It is importatnt to consider the 
customers needs when designing the system because ultimatley, it is their system. They are the ones paying for it and what they want
or need should be implemented.
The way to approach designing software consists of a few methods. One would be interviewing which would provide information on what 
the customer needs and/or wants the system to do. After that would be to plan, which involves discussing with a team and creating 
diagrams. Next would be developement and testing. Lastly, the system would be presented to the customer to see if they approve.
